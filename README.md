## My process
I started by visualizing my project and then started my code. The easiest way to build this project was to create divs inside of divs. 
Once that was done i went on to the styling in css and added the appropriate styles to make it similar to the challenge. 

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
I've gotten better at using grid and not having to add so many styles to get the content where I wanted it. 

### Continued development
Even though I used a filter with hue i was unable to add a purple hue to my image so I will continue trying till i get.
